## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This project was started to combine industrial controllers, open-source controllers, and the freedom of customization.

1. Project Name & Description
   
    TUXMIO= 2XMIO=MIO+MIO=Make It Own Modular Input/Output System
TUXMIO is a customizable Modular Input/Output System. It allows users to mix and match hardware while keeping full control over their automation systems.

2. Features
   
    âœ” Modular Design â€“ Easily expand and customize I/O modules based on project needs.
  
    âœ” Hybrid Compatibility â€“ Works with both industrial controllers (PLC, DCS) and open-source hardware (Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi).
  
    âœ” Cross-Platform Support â€“ Works with Linux, Windows, and embedded systems.
  
    âœ” Industrial-Grade Reliability â€“ Designed for rugged environments with robust protection features.
  
    âœ” Flexible Manufacturing Options â€“ Users can build it themselves, order custom production, or buy pre-assembled modules.

3. Installation & Setup
   
    Hardware:
  
    âœ” Choose your favorite open-source controller
  
    âœ” Connect it to TUXMIO
  
    âœ” Enjoy your controller in an industrial environment
  
    Software & Setup:
  
    Use your usual tools for firmware installation, configuration, and testingâ€”just like you always do!

4. Usage

    After setup, just start your system and enjoy your creation.

5. Hardware Requirements

    âœ” Choose your favorite open-source controller (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP32, etc.).
   
    âœ” TUXMIO modules (customize based on your needs).
   
    âœ” You can prepare your own power supply voltages, or use the TUXMIO PS board for convenience.
   
    âœ” Any additional sensors, actuators, or peripherals based on your project.
